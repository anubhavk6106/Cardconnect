## üîÑ Workflow Changes

### Old Flow (Card-based Discounts)
```
1. Card Owner adds card ‚Üí enters discount details
2. Buyer browses cards ‚Üí sees discounts on cards
3. Buyer requests transaction ‚Üí discount from card
4. Transaction created with card's discount
```

### New Flow (Product-based Offers)
```
1. Card Owner adds card ‚Üí only basic details (no discounts)
2. Admin adds products ‚Üí configures card offers per product
3. Buyer browses products ‚Üí system matches their cards with offers
4. System shows best applicable offer automatically
5. Transaction created with product's matched offer
```

---

## üîç How Offer Matching Works

```javascript
// For each product, the system:
1. Fetches user's active cards
2. Loops through product's cardOffers
3. For each offer, checks:
   - Card network matches (or offer is for "All")
   - Card type matches (or offer is for "both")
   - Bank name matches (or offer has no bank restriction)
   - Offer is still valid (validUntil > today)
   - Product price meets minPurchase requirement
4. Calculates discount (percentage of price, capped at maxDiscount)
5. Returns offer with highest discount amount
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Backup database:**
   ```bash
   mongodump --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017/cardconnect" --out=./backup
   ```

2. **Pull latest code:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Install dependencies (if any new packages):**
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

4. **Run migration scripts:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node scripts/migrateCardDiscounts.js
   node scripts/addSampleCardOffers.js
   ```

5. **Restart services:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   npm start

   # Frontend (new terminal)
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Test functionality** (use checklist above)

## üìä Benefits

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Card Owner Effort** | High - Must track & update discounts | Low - Only basic card info |
| **Data Accuracy** | Prone to errors & outdated info | Centralized, admin-managed |
| **Buyer Experience** | Search by cards, see discounts | Search by products, auto-matched best offer |
| **Scalability** | Hard to update offers across cards | Easy to manage offers per product |
| **Integration** | Manual entry only | Ready for external API integration |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **No data loss:** Old card discount data is removed, but all transaction history is preserved
2. **Admin responsibility:** Admins must now maintain product card offers
3. **API breaking changes:** Old card APIs with discount filters won't work
4. **Frontend compatibility:** Old frontend won't work with new backend
5. **Migration is one-way:** Difficult to rollback after offer data is added

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check migration logs for errors
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Ensure all required fields are present in models
4. Test API endpoints individually
5. Check browser console for frontend errors
