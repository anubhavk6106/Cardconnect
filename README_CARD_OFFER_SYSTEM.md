## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Backup Database
```bash
mongodump --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017/cardconnect" --out=./backup
```

### Step 2: Run Migration Scripts
```bash
cd backend

# Remove old discount data from cards
node scripts/migrateCardDiscounts.js

# Add sample card offers to products (customize first!)
node scripts/addSampleCardOffers.js
```

### Step 3: Start Services
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the System
1. **As Card Owner**: Add a new card (only basic details)
2. **As Buyer**: Browse products (see matched offers)
3. **As Buyer**: Request transaction (discount auto-applied)
4. **Verify**: Check transaction has correct discount

## 🔄 How It Works

### Old System Flow
```
1. Card Owner adds card with discount details
2. Buyer searches/browses cards
3. Buyer sees discounts on cards
4. Transaction uses card's discount
```

### New System Flow
```
1. Card Owner adds card (basic details only)
2. Admin adds products with card offers
3. Buyer browses products
4. System matches buyer's cards with product offers
5. Shows best offer automatically
6. Transaction uses matched offer discount
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# 1. Test card addition
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/cards \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bankName": "HDFC Bank",
    "cardType": "credit",
    "cardNetwork": "Visa",
    "lastFourDigits": "1234"
  }'

# 2. Test product browsing
curl http://localhost:5000/api/products?platform=Amazon \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# 3. Test transaction creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "cardId": "<card_id>",
    "product": {
      "name": "Test Product",
      "url": "https://example.com/product",
      "platform": "Amazon",
      "originalPrice": 10000
    }
  }'
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Breaking Changes**: This is a major refactor with breaking API changes
2. **One-Way Migration**: Difficult to rollback after running migration scripts
3. **Admin Responsibility**: Admins must now maintain product offers
4. **Frontend Updates**: Old frontend will not work with new backend
5. **Database Cleanup**: Old card discount data will be removed

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Need at least one card" | Add a card first before browsing products |
| "No valid offer found" | Check card matches product offer criteria |
| Products show no offers | Verify cardOffers are populated and valid |
| Discount fields still show | Clear browser cache, hard refresh |
| Migration script fails | Check database connection, backup first |
